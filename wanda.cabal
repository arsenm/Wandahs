Synopsis: Wanda the fish
Description: Wanda, the unofficial GNOME mascot! A swimming fish
             inspired partially by the "fish" panel applet and the "free the fish"
             easter egg. Wanda is a fish who will swim around your screen, and when
             clicked she can either give you a fortune, or simply run away for a
             while providing countless hours of entertainment and inquiries as to
             why there's a fish swimming around your screen.
